Smart Cart and Shopping cart side by side
		
The smart shows the top three elements the user is most likely to buy. The items in the smart cart are 
selected by a prediction algorithm. 
The algorithm learns based on the userâ€™s selection and becomes more accurate over time.

	If the user has not visited the smart cart, then while checking out the pop up will be shown 
with the suggestions from smart cart. If the user happens to have visited the smart cart in in the journey,
 the pop up wont be shown.
